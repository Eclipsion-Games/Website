This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It uses a simple vanilla JavaScript setup. To develop locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Static assets such as the `CNAME` file are placed in the `public` directory so that they are copied into the final `dist` output.
